### lines start with "#" are comments; in-line comments are NOT supported.
### First, note the number of objects, using a line starting with 'n'
### Second, provide n positions
### 'p' is followed by three float numbers separated by space,
### suggesting the x-y-z coordinates of the centroid of an object
### there must be n p-entries
### Then, provide n rotations
### 'e' is followed by three float numbers separated by space,
### suggesting the pitch, yaw roll of an object in degrees
### there must be n e-entries
### Then, there are n minus 6 v-entries, indicating the initial velocity of moving objects
### finally, there are n minus 6 a-entries, indicating the initial angular velocity of moving objects
