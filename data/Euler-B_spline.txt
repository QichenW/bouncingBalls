### lines start with "#" are comments; in-line comments are NOT supported.
### First, note the number of key frames, using a line starting with 'n'
### Second, provide n positions
### 'p' is followed by three float numbers separated by space,
### suggesting the x-y-z coordinates of a control point
### there must be n entries
### Then, provide n positions
### 'e' is followed by three float numbers separated by space,
### suggesting the pitch, yaw roll of a frame in degrees
### there must be n entries
### Then, choose the orientation presentation 0 -> euler angle; 1-> quaternion
### Finally, choose the interpolation method 0 -> 3rd order Catmull-Rom; 1 -> 3rd order B-spline
